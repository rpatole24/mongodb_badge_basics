## Reflection  

One thing that really stood out to me is based on how the data is organized, such as how SQL uses tables with fixed schemas, so all the data has to fit into a specific structure, whereas MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which makes it easier to handle information that isn’t uniform. Another difference is scalability, MongoDB can spread across multiple servers more easily than traditional relational databases. I also noticed that queries in MongoDB can be more intuitive when working with nested or complex data, while MySQL is better when you need strict relationships between data points. Overall, MongoDB feels more adaptable for data that changes often, while MySQL is better for consistent, structured data. In healthcare, MongoDB would be useful for storing data from wearable devices because the data comes in many different formats and updates constantly, and its flexible structure makes it easier to manage and analyze.
